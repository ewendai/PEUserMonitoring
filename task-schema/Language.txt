Consider the language used in the passage for these questions.
"""


1.01 cl Which of the following appears in the bolded text to the left? Check all that apply, or none, and highlight the part of the passage in which you see each.

1.01.01 Metaphorical Language
"""
**Metaphorical language**(references another object to which it is not related, similes)
is often good writing, and not problematic. But sometimes it is used to color an event in a biased way, especially in negative metaphors of disease, filth, or invasion. You will have a chance later to say if any metaphors or analogies you find are misleading or just fine.

> E.g.She ran **as fast as a river**.

*This includes both metaphors (“He’s an eagle on the field”) and similes (He’s like an eagle on the field”). *
"""
1.01.02 Exaggeration
"""
**Exaggeration**(hyperbole) is sometimes used for comic effect. You will get a chance later to say how misleading you think the exaggeration is.

> E.g. This new salesperson made an **enormous** difference in the store’s revenue.

*The word “enormous” is an exaggeration. Although it is possible that the salesperson made a difference in revenue, the word “enormous” is probably an exaggeration. *
"""
1.01.03 Scandal
"""
**Scandal** (i.e. portrayal of immoral actions/situations/behavior), or treating discoveries as scandalous, is often used to distract from more important issues or to encourage certain emotional reactions to an event or discovery (e.g. outrage, disgust).

> E.g. It turned out that our principal was **secretly dating** our history teacher.

*Dating in secret is seen as somewhat immoral, or the reason for dating in secret is usually immoral. The author could have instead phrased it in a way that does not imply scandal.*
"""
1.01.04 Emotional tone (including expletives)
"""
**Emotional tones** are emotional expressions such as humor, threat, joy, and expletives.
> E.g. **Screw** Stanford, they’re all full of themselves.

*The expletive is an example of emotional tone.*

> E.g. We were **furious** that they stole the axe.

*The word “furious” conveys emotions.*

You will have a chance later to say just how problematic the emotional tone is; it is sometimes but not always inappropriate.
"""
1.01.05 Shock or surprise
"""
Including exclamation points or other form of conveying surprise.
> E.g. I **couldn’t believe** that he had shaved off all of his hair.

*The "couldn't believe" shows surprise that the person shaved off his hair. This potentially alters how readers view the fact that the male subject of the sentence shaved his head.*
"""
1.01.06 Slang
"""
**Slang** (Informal terms that are usually spoken and not written.)
> E.g. After the game, the student section **rushed the field**.

*“Rushing the field” is a slang term that refers to when fans (usually from the winning side) go onto the field after a sports match.*
"""
1.01.07 Typos
"""
**Typos** (Misspelling of words or punctuation).
> E.g. They were **mispelling** words left and rite.

*Typos include spelling a word wrong as well as using the wrong homophone (rite/right, your/you’re, etc.).*
"""
1.01.08 Bad grammar
"""
> E.g. Even though they were scared.

*This is bad grammar because it is not a complete sentence.*

> E.g. **Us** are going to the concert together.

*The “us” should be a “we”.*

> E.g. Each one of us **are** leaving on a different day.

*Words like “each” and “every” are singular.*
"""
1.01.09 Misleading or confusing sentence structure
"""
**Misleading or confusing sentence structure** (Unclear about what the sentence is saying).
> E.g. After getting lunch, Max went to the market to get dinner but he had had breakfast there already.

*This sentence does not make a lot of sense, and the wording of the second half, especially the use of the word “but” could be misleading.*
"""
1.01.10 Other unnecessary or misleading coloring of language
"""
> E.g. The young, female senator proposed naive legislation.
"""
1.01.11 Colorful but not misleading in any way
"""
**Colorful but not misleading in any way** (Irrelevant details that do not affect the information).
> E.g. The **very short** lady kept yelling at us for ruining her carpet.
"""
1.01.12 Other problem with language

- Example of Metaphorical Language **NOT AT ALL excessive/inappropriate**

*In this case, the sentence is suggesting that the wind was very strong and loud. Although it is subjective how appropriate this use of metaphor is, since wind occasionally makes noises that sound like howls, this seems more on the appropriate side of the scale.*

- Example of Metaphorical Language **CONSIDERABLY excessive/inappropriate**
>Her stomach felt like a **raging river**.

*In this case, the raging river comparison conveys that her stomach is unsettled or that she is not feeling well, but it is an exaggeration and does not really help to give us additional information.*

- Example of Exaggeration that **Considerably misrepresents reality**
> The **ant was the size of Texas**.

*There is no ant that exists that is actually the size of Texas. While conveying that the ant was large in size, it does not give us an accurate description of how big the ant was. However, it can also be said that this is not a misrepresentation since it is common knowledge that ants are small.*

- Example of **less appropriate slang**:
> She is **gonna** go to the market.

This question only pops up if you highlighted something for Typos/ Bad Grammar/Misleading or Confusing Sentence Structures in Question 1.

A typo of punctuation is often only "slightly" confusing, whereas misleading or confusing sentence structure can encourage the opposite meaning.

- Example of **Not At All/Mildly confusing**:
> They were **mispelling** words left and **rite**.

*These typos are not too serious and it is still clear what the sentence is trying to convey.*
> Each one of us **are** leaving on a different day.

*Again, even though the grammar is incorrect, it is still possible to understand the sentence.*

- Example of **Considerably confusing**:
>She walked her dogs then came back home where her grandchildren were. When she arrived, she gave them a bath.

*The second sentence is confusing because it is unclear whether she is giving her dogs a bath or her grandchildren a bath.*
